Abstract in English 
The COVID-19 pandemic, which emerged in late 2019, rapidly escalated into a global health 
crisis, bringing widespread changes. This study investigates the impact of the pandemic on 
Swiss emerging adults, focusing on three dimensions: the transition to adulthood, mental 
health, and social cohesion. Using longitudinal data from the Swiss Household Panel, the 
research analyzes individuals aged 18-25 from 2017 to 2021. The hypotheses anticipated 
delays in adulthood milestones, deteriorating mental health with a potential gender bias 
towards females, and declining social cohesion. Through the construction of outcomes and 
sample reweighting, we analyzed these hypotheses using generalized estimating equations. 
While there was no direct association between COVID-19 and delayed transition to adulthood, 
the pandemic did seem to aggravate existing mental health gender disparities. The study 
observed an increase in social cohesion, though the long-term implications of this trend are 
yet to be determined. These results highlight how the pandemic intensified existing 
inequalities, underscore the critical need for targeted post-pandemic interventions and offers 
important insights for effectively handling future crises.

This study has been realized using the data collected by the Swiss Household Panel (SHP), 
which is based at the Swiss Centre of Expertise in the Social Sciences FORS. The project is 
financed by the Swiss National Science Foundation.
